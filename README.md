ORF
Don't exactly remember what it does. Made it long time back when I was naive and did not spend time on proper documentation.
Something to do with getting orfs, translating peptides if instead of AUG, some other codon is recognised as start codon, etc etc.
Takes gene list with -50 to +50 sequence of that gene as input in a 'fasta' file.
Outputs a text file with the genes and its attributes in a tabular format
